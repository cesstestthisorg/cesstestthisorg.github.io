{"name":"Tunapanda Swag Documentation","tagline":"","body":"Swag - Technical Overview\r\nIntroduction\r\n \r\nSwag is a system for guiding learners through different learning paths. It does not dictate a \r\nspecific path to the learner, but suggests that some knowledge are prerequisites to other \r\nknowledge. It engages the user by relying on metaphors from computer games, and tries to \r\ntrigger the users curiosity for exploration and desire for completeness. \r\n \r\n# Concepts\r\nThere are some concepts that work together to make up the complete system. These are \r\ndescribed in more detail on the following pages. \r\n \r\n## ● Swagmap \r\nA map of interconnected nodes that guides the user through the learning experience. \r\n  \r\n## ● Swagifact \r\nAn atom of learning. Each node in the swagmap is a swagifact. \r\n \r\n● Learning Record Store \r\nThe database that keeps track of which swagifacts each user has completed. \r\n \r\n● Reporting Applications \r\nAn application that sits in the background and gather information about what the user \r\ndoes and reports this to the Learning Record Store. \r\n# ### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
